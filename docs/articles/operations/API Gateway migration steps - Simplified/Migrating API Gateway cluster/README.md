# Migrating API Gateway cluster

Supported Versions: 10.3 Fix 4 and above

Overview of the tutorial
------------------------

This tutorial explains in detail the steps needed for migrating an API Gateway **cluster**.

**Note:** This tutorial is applicable for on-premise installation only

Required knowledge
------------------

The tutorial assumes that the reader has,

*   a basic knowledge on the API Gateway as a product
*   a basic understanding on Elasticsearch (Internal Data Store)

Why?
----

The migration utility introduced in API Gateway provides following support.

*   Migration of Elasticsearch and API Gateway file configurations can be done separately
*   Migration of data from externally configured Elasticsearch is supported
*   Logs all the details to a standard file, migrationLog.txt, a single file for all the log data
*   Supports reverting in case of failure in Elasticsearch data migration

Prerequisite steps
------------------

Complete the below prerequisites to make you ready to get into the details of the staging and promotion in API Gateway.

*   Install source and target API Gateway instances. The version of target API Gateway should be higher than source API Gateway. Supported source API Gateway versions are 10.1 and above
*   Install latest fixes in both source and target versions
*   If custom keystore files are used in the source API Gateway installation, copy the files to the same location in the target installation

> **Note:** If the source Elasticsearch port is not accessible to target instance and not able to talk to each other then Contact Software AG support team for further assistance.

Details
-------

In this section we will go through the steps for migrating an API Gateway cluster to a higher version. The steps are given below.

**Note:** In APIGateway 10.2 and above the the folder name _**EventDataStore**_ has been changed to _**InternalDataStore**_. Throughout this tutorial we refer source API Gateway installation directory as \<SOURCE\>, target API Gateway installation directory as \<TARGET\> and target elasticsearch is <TARGET\_ELASTIC\_SEARCH>

### Step 1: Configure path.repo in source Elasticsearch

Go to **_\<SOURCE\>\\InternalDataStore\\config_** and configure _**path.repo**_ property in _**elasticsearch.yml**_ file for all the nodes. Make sure that the path.repo is a shared network folder and should be accessible for all the Elasticsearch nodes in the cluster

### Step 2: Configure reindex.remote.whitelist in target Elasticsearch instances

> **Note:** Remote reindexing configuration can be skipped for Managed Elasticsearch


Configure the below property in all the target Elasticsearch instance's _elasticsearch.yml_ file located at _**\<TARGET\>\\InternalDataStore\\config**_ for re-indexing the data in the target Elasticsearch. The below property helps to copy the documents from \<SOURCE\> to \<TARGET\> Elasticsearch instances.

##### elasticsearch.yml

```
reindex.remote.whitelist: <source_host>:<source_port>

(This value should match with the value of the property pg.gateway.elasticsearch.hosts present in
<SOURCE>\IntegrationServer\instances\``default``\packages\WmAPIGateway\config\resource\elasticsearch\config.properties)
```

For example, the below file contains localhost:9240 for reindex.remote.whitelist property.

### Step 2 (Optional): Configure Elasticsearch host for source API Gateways

> **Note:** This step is applicable only if the source API Gateway version is 10.1.  From 10.2  these values are populated automatically.

Configure source Elasticsearch host and port details in the file _**config.properties**_ file which is located at _\<SOURCE\>\\IntegrationServer\\instances\\default\\packages\\WmAPIGateway\\config\\resources\\elasticsearch_. Do this for all the API Gateway nodes.

##### config.properties

```
pg.gateway.elasticsearch.hosts=<source_host>:<source_port>
```

### Step 3: Configure basic auth credentials to connect to source Elasticsearch

If the source Elasticsearch instance is protected with basic authentication add the below properties in _\<SOURCE\>\\IntegrationServer\\instances\\default\\packages\\WmAPIGateway\\config\\resources\\elasticsearch\\config.properties_ file. Do this for all the API Gateway nodes.

##### config.properties

```
pg.gateway.elasticsearch.http.username=<username>
pg.gateway.elasticsearch.http.password=<password> 
```

### Step 4: Configure certificates to connect to source Elasticsearch

If the source Elasticsearch is protected with HTTPS, add the source certificates (public key) into the target Elasticsearch JVM's truststore. For e.g, In case of internal data store we need to add the public keys to the truststore cacerts file located at _**\<TARGET\>\\jvm\\jvm\\jre\\lib\\security**_. Do this for all the target API Gateway nodes.

> **Note:** If external Elasticsearch is used for the target API Gateway then the certificates should be imported to its corresponding JVM

Below is a sample command to import the truststore of source Elasticsearch in to target Elasticsearch JVM.

_**$\<TARGET\>\\jvm\\jvm\\bin\\keytool -import -keystore \<TARGET\>\\jvm\\jvm\\jre\\lib\\security\\cacerts -file <truststore.jks\> -alias <alias\>**_

| **Property**     | **Detail**                                                   | **Example**             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| \<truststore.jks\> | Truststore used in \<SOURCE\> Elasticsearch. Provide the full path of the truststore.For 10.1 it should be available at *\<SOURCE\>\WmAPIGateway\config\resources\bean\gateway-es-store.xml*property ***\<prop key="searchguard.ssl.http.truststore_filepath"\>sagconfig/root-ca.jks\</prop\>\***For 10.2 and above it will be available at *\<SOURCE\>\WmAPIGateway\config\resources\elasticsearch\config.properties*property ***pg.gateway.elasticsearch.https.truststore.filepath\*** | *sagconfig/root-ca.jks* |
| \<alias\>          | This is the alias used in \<SOURCE\> Elasticsearch             | wm.sag.com              |

### Step 5: Start source and target Elasticsearch instances

Start all the source and target Elasticsearch instances and make sure that IS instances are NOT started. Also avoid Elasticsearch port conflict.

> **Note: Avoid port conflict:** If source and target API Gateway instances are running in the same machine, then the user might not able to start both the source and target Elasticsearch instances in parallel with the default port configurations. In that case the target Elasticsearch instance port can be changed temporarily for running the migration. Both HTTP and TCP ports must be changed. Follow the below steps.
>
> 1\. Go to **_\<TARGET\>/InternalDataStore/config_** directory, open the elasticsearch.yml file, and change the value of the HTTP port in the http.port property and the TCP port in the transport.tcp.port and discovery.zen.ping.unicast.hosts properties
>
> 2\. Go to **_\<TARGET\>/IntegrationServer/instances/default/packages/WmAPIGateway/config/resources/elasticsearch_** directory, open the config.properties file and find the pg.gateway.elasticsearch.hosts property. If the property is set to changeOnInstall then you need to do nothing further. If there is a port configured already, update it to a new value

### Step 6: Run migration for Elasticsearch data

> **Note:** Before running the migration, setup the target Elasticsearch cluster and make sure that all the source and target Elasticsearch instances in the clusters are up and running. But API Gateway instances should not be started on any of the nodes.

Now we will start running the migration process. The migration process consist of migration of Elasticsearch data and API Gateway configurations and both will be done by running the migration utility command at \<TARGET\> API Gateway machine.

In this step we will migrate the Elasticsearch data. 

Go to _\<TARGET\>\\IntegrationServer\\instances\\default\\packages\\WmAPIGateway\\bin\\migrate_ and run the below command.

> **Note:**  This should be done in only one target API Gateway node of the cluster.

_**$> migrate.bat datastore -dstoreSrc \<full path to source Elasticsearch config.properties\>**_

| **Parameter** | **Description**                                              |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| dstoreSrc     | If source and target API Gateway instances are running in the same network. Provide the location where \<SOURCE\> config.properties file is located.Sample:*migrate.bat datastore -dstoreSrc* *\<SOURCE\>\IntegrationServer\instances\default\packages\WmAPIGateway\config\resources\elasticsearch\config.properties* |
|               | If the source and target instances are running in different machines, the the source installation directory or at least the Elasticsearch *config.properties* file must be shared in the network. Otherwise just copy and paste the source config.properties to the shared location.Sample:*migrate.bat datastore -dstoreSrc* *\\chebackup01\installations\source\IntegrationServer\instances\default\packages\WmAPIGateway\config\resources\elasticsearch\config.properties* |

For e.g,

_$> migrate.bat datastore -dstoreSrc_ 

_\\\\chebackup01\\source\\IntegrationServer\\instances\\default\\packages\\WmAPIGateway\\config\\resources\\elasticsearch\\config.properties_

![](attachments/image2019-5-28_15-52-33.png)

### Step 7: Run migration for IS configurations

In this step we will migrate the Integration Server's configuration to target instance. Go to \<TARGET\>\\IntegrationServer\\instances\\default\\packages\\WmAPIGateway\\bin\\migrate and run the below command. Please make sure that this command is run in all the target API Gateway nodes of the cluster.

_**$> migrate.bat apigateway -srcDir \<SOURCE\> -instanceName \<source instance name\> -newInstanceName \<target instance name\>**_

| **Parameter**   | **Description**                                              | **Sample command**                                           |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| srcDir          | If the source API Gateway instance is installed in the same network, provide the source API Gateway installation directory | *-srcDir C:\installations\source*                            |
|                 | If the source API Gateway instance is installed in a different network, then share the entire installation folder. | *-srcDir \\chebackup01\source*                               |
| instanceName    | This is an optional parameter. Here we need to pass \<SOURCE\> instance name.If you don't provide any name then *default* will be assigned. If you want to migrate different instance other than *default* provide its name. (To know more about Integration server instances please refer its doc) | *-instanceName default**-instanceName dev**-instanceName test* |
| newInstanceName | This is an optional parameter. Here we need to pass \<TARGET\> instance name.If you don't provide any name then *default* will be assigned. If you have created a new instance other than *default* in Integration server and you want to migrate to the new instance then provide its name. | *-newInstanceName default**-newInstanceName qa**-newInstanceName prod* |

A sample run command is given below.

_$> migrate.bat  apigateway  -srcDir  C:\\installations\\source  -instanceName  default  -newInstanceName default_

#### File system configurations

The following configurations are persisted in file system and some of them are covered using IS migration. Please verify the correctness of these configurations in the target environment once the above migration procedures are executed. Configurations changes done in elasticsearch.yml, kibana.yml etc are not covered using the migration procedure, can be migrated manually. 

> **Note**: Most of the configurations can be configured using externalized configurations. For information on externalization,  refer **[this](https://tech.forums.softwareag.com/t/starting-api-gateway-using-externalized-configurations/237312)** tech community article.

The configurations are listed below.

| Configuration                      | File name                                                    | File location                                                |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Elasticsearch configuration        | elasticsearch.yml                                            | SAGInstallDir/InternalDataStore/config/                      |
| Elasticsearch client configuration | config.properties                                            | SAGInstallDir/IntegrationServer/instances/<br/>instance_name/packages/WmAPIGateway/config/<br/>resources/elasticsearch/ |
| Kibana configuration               | kibana.yml                                                   | SAGInstallDir/profiles/instance_name/<br/>apigateway/dashboard/config/ |
| Master password                    | mpw.dat                                                      | SAGInstallDir/profiles/instance_name/<br/>configuration/security/passman/ |
| UI configurations                  | uiconfiguration.properties                                   | SAGInstallDir/profiles/instance_name/<br/>apigateway/config/ |
| SAML group mapping                 | saml_groups_mapping.xml                                      | SAGInstallDir/IntegrationServer/instances/<br/>instance_name/packages/WmAPIGateway/config/<br/>resources/security/ |

| Custom wrapper settings            | custom_wrapper.conf  | SAGInstallDir/profiles/instance_name/configuration/ |

##### Server ports configuration

If the portClusteringEnabled extended setting is set to false, the server ports should be created in each instance by the Administrator.

##### SAML SSO Configuration

Ensure that the following files in SAML SSO configuration (SSO configuration done in API Gateway Admin UI) are accessible to the new instance. If not, manually copy those files to the new instance.

*   IDP metadata 
*   Gateway metadata
*   Keystore

##### Custom ESB packages

Also make sure that all the custom packages are installed and ready in the new instance(s).

### Step 8: Post migration steps

This is a post migration step. Follow the below steps.

*   Shutdown the target Elasticsearch instances
*   Start target API Gateway nodes
*   You can find the logs  at target directory  _**\<TARGET\>/install/logs/migrationLog.txt**_ 
*   You can find the API Gateway migration reports at  _**\<TARGET\>\\install\\logs\\APIGW\_Migration\_Reports\_<date\_time>**_

### General Migration configurations

API Gateway customers can modify certain parameters for migration based on their requirements by modifying the property file _**migration.properties**_ which is located at _\<TARGET\>\\IntegrationServer\\instances\\default\\packages\\WmAPIGateway\\bin\\migrate_. This property file is instance specific and customers can have different configurations while migrating different instances.

| **Property**                                             | **Description**                                              | **Default value** | **Possible values**                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| apigateway.migration.srcTenantName                       | By default, the source tenant is assumed as default. But If the source API Gateway has multiple tenants, this property can be used to specify the tenant name from which the data has to be migrated to the target tenant. | default           | Any available tenant in Elasticsearch                        |
| apigateway.migration.batchSize                           | The batch size with which the data is processed. For e.g if size is 100 then by default 100 documents will be processed first. If the network is slow we can decrease this value and if the network is better we can increase this value. | 100               | Appropriate batch size. It depends on the number of documents and the size of the documents in the data store |
| apigateway.migration.logLevel                            | Log level for migration. we can change log level to debug, error etc. | info              | info,debug,error,warn,trace                                  |
| apigateway.migration.reindex.status.check.sleep.interval | Interval configuration in milliseconds. Once the re-indexing process has started from source to target instances, migration process will wake up after every configured sleep interval to check whether the re-indexing is complete. It will check the status of the task id | 5000              | Appropriate sleep interval                                   |

### Recovery

During migration, if there is any problem in the execution or any of the handlers got failed, to make sure that assets are migrated properly, we can clean the target instance once and then re run the migration. This clean command will clean the target data store  (the one configured in the config.properties of target machine) . During this procedure all the indices will be removed and this is a non reversible action. Before cleaning the data we will also take a backup of the existing data (you can also restore it). Once cleaned, we can re-run the migration. Also once you trigger the clean command, this process will wait for 5 seconds and if you wrongly triggered it and you want to kill this process you can do that with in that 5 seconds interval.

### Clean command

> **Note (Before running clean command):** If the \<TARGET\> is 10.5 and the clean command is executed in a cluster, go to \<SOURCE\>\\InternalDataStore\\config and configure path.repo property in elasticsearch.yml file for all the nodes. Make sure that the path.repo is a shared network folder and should be accessible for all the Elasticsearch nodes in the cluster. 

Go to _\<TARGET\>\\IntegrationServer\\instances\\default\\packages\\WmAPIGateway\\bin\\migrate_

For Managed Elasticsearch run clean command with backup option false

_**$> migrate.bat clean -backup false**_

else run clean command with backup option true which is default.

_**$> migrate.bat clean**_

> **Note:** Since this command removes all the assets from data store, make sure that the target data store is properly configured in config.properties which is located at \<TARGET\>\\IntegrationServer\\instances\\default\\packages\\WmAPIGateway\\config\\resources\\elasticsearch.
