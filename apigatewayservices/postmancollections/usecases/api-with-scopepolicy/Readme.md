# API with Scope Policy

#### Scope Policy

The sample use case in this folder allows you to:
- create API using petstore URL (http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json)
- retrieve API details using API Id
- create Log Invocation policy action
- enforce Scope policy for the API at resource or method level
- activate the API

At the end of the use case, you have an API enforced with scope policy in 'activated' state.
