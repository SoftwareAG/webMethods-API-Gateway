# API with Custom Extension

#### Custom Extension

The sample use case in this folder allows you to:
- create API using petstore URL (http://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.json)
- create external callout custome extension policy
- retrieve API's policy details using its policy Id
- associated policy actions with the API policy
- activate the API

At the end of the use case, you have an API with Custom Extension policy in 'activated' state.
