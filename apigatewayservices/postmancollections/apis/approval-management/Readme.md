# Approval Management

* API Gateway user can do basic CRUD operations on resources like API, Application, Package, and Plans and so on without any secondary approval. However, administrators can restrict the basic CRUD operations using Approval Configuration.

* Administrators can enable approval configuration for required transactions to restrict users from performing them. When Approval Configuration is enabled, the transactions can be performed only with approval from authorized users.

* Use the sample payloads in this folder to create, update, delete, or view the list of approval configurations available in API Gateway.
