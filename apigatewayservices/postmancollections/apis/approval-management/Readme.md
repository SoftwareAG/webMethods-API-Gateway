# Approval Management

* API Gateway user can do basic CRUD operations on resources like API, Application, Package and Plans and so on without any supervision. But if the user wants to restrict the basic CRUD operations then they can use Approval Configuration.
* Once the user enabled approval configuration for respective events then without accepting/rejecting the approval request nothing will take place.
* Use the sample payloads in this folder to create, update, delete, or view the list of approval configurations available in API Gateway.
