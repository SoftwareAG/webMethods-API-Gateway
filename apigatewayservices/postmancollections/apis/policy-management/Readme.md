# Policy Management

* Policies are the set of rules that gets enforced on the APIs (or even at finer levels like operations/methods) for every invocation of the API.
* In API Gateway, a policy is made up of a set of policy actions. During an invocation of an API, API Gateway executes every policy action in the policy in a sequential manner.
* Use the sample payloads in this folder to retrieve create, update, delete policies, and also manage policy related data such as policies, parameters,policy actions, policy stages, policy templates, binding assertion, token assertion and service result cache.
