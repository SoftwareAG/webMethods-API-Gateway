# Alias Management

* You need the 'Manage aliases' functional privilege to manage aliases in API Gateway.

* An alias in API Gateway holds environment-specific property values that can be used in policy routing configurations. 

* The aliases can be referred in

  1. Routing endpoints

  2. Routing rules

  3. Endpoint connection properties

  4. Outbound authentication tokens

  5. Outbound HTTP headers instead of providing an actual value.

* Use the sample payloads in this folder to create aliases, retrieve alias information, update alias properties as required, and delete the existing aliases.
