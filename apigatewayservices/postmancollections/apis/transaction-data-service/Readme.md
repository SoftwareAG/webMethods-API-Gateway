# Transaction Data Service

* API Gateway Transactions service allows you to query the API transactions.
* API Transactions are generated (as events) every time an API invocation happens. API Transactions may contain the details about the invocation such as request/response headers, request/response payloads, consumer applications and so on.
* Use the sample query payloads in this folder to retrieve the transaction events data of APIs in API Gateway.
