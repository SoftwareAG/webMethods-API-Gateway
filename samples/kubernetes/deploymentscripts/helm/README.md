# Helm Chart

The API Gateway installation provides a sample helm chart. API Gateway uses Helm to streamline
the Kubernetes installation and management. Helm allows you to easily templatize the Kubernetes
deployments and provides a set of configuration parameters that you can use to customize the
deployment. Helm chart combines the Kubernetes deployments and provides a service to manage
them.
